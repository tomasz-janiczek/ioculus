[ iOculus sample application ]

* Introduction

This pre-alpha version was tested under the following operating systems:
- Linux (Debian Sarge),
- Windows (XP Professional)
and browsers such as:
- Firefox (2.0)

It will not work under Internet Explorer. To be exact - it will, but the CSS are W3C compatible,
so IE will not always know what to do with them. This is only temporary and will be soon fixed
(unfortunately, we need to support IE...)

* How to install?

1. Create a MySQL database (you can choose freely its name).
2. Unzip/untar the iOculus archive to a folder of your choosing and point a domain to it.
   IMPORTANT! In this version iOculus will not work in a subfolder. It must have its own domain.
   It can be localhost, or a another "local" domain, but not, for example, localhost/ioculus.
2. Open the following URL in your browser:
   
    http://yourdomain.tld/?m=install
   
   Do NOT open http://yourdomain.tld/ - you'll get an error, as the database isn't yet set up.
4. A simple, 3 step installer will show up. Follow the onscreen instructions.
5. After you've completed the installation, go to http://youdomain.tld.
   Clicking the OK button on the last step will do exactly the same.
6. Ready.

Please remeber!
This is a early pre-alpha version. Practically, its a snapshot, that isn't
yet ready to be published. But we urgently need help developing it, so...
Here it goes.
